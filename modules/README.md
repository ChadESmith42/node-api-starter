# MODULES

Modules handle the business logic rather than your routes and DB functions.

Some examples:

- Make API calls to 3rd party APIs
- Validated data coming from API requests
- Transform data structures to match the DB
- Validate tokens/authentication for each request
- Handle error message generation

Anything related to business logic should be here, neatly packaged in separate files.
